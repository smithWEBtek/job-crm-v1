<h2>Hello World, trying to get Heroku, Rails, Github, Tower, my other application and myself....all in harmony, sometime today if possible.</h2>
<p>
  We are going to have a family brunch today.
</p>

<p>Here are some changes that I will push to Heroku first, to see what happens in terms of Github's point of view, of my local app.
I 'expect' that Github will see modified files like usual, and I'll have the usual options to add, commit, push.</p>

  
  The time is now: <%= Time.now %>
</p>
