NOTE: as I review curriculum, I will capture lists and action items that can be integrated into this app.

URL and list and Note, top to bottom in order that curriculum presents it.

  An effective job search involves (but isn’t limited to):
    In-person networking
    Sending emails
    Arranging informal coffee meetings
    Building an online presence through social media and blogging
    Creating side projects you can add to your portfolio
    Phone interviews
    Code challenges
    Continued learning

  WAYS TO BE PROACTIVE IN YOUR JOB HUNT
    Below are activities that define a proactive job search.
      Schedule time in your calendar for specific job search related tasks. I.e. 1 hour to research open positions, 2 hours emailing new and existing contacts, another 30 minutes following up, etc.
      Research job openings, companies you want to work for, and people you already know (or have mutual connections with) that work at those companies.
      Attend in-person networking events (meetups, conferences, association meetings, etc.)
      Join online groups around a particular interest/industry. Example: a Ruby on Rails LinkedIn group.
      Create an online presence by using social media (like LinkedIn and Twitter) as well as starting to blog.
      Consider volunteering your web development skills for an organization you care about (something you can add to your LinkedIn/portfolio!)
      Build mini apps (aka “side projects”) that people can actually use and find value from (another thing you can add to your LinkedIn/portfolio.)
      Prepare answers to common interview questions you may be asked.
      Practice code challenges as a way to prepare for interviews.

  Active job seekers are committed to finding a job and put in the hard work associated with it. As an active seeker you'll block out time to search for opportunities, research companies and positions, network with influencers, establish a job search tracking system, and follow up with contacts.
    Here are practices active seekers put into place:

      Building - apps, projects, etc. Ultimately, assembling a portfolio of work samples.
      Blogging - as a way to document learning or discuss news/events in the industry.
      Networking - going to meetups, conferences, and other events.
      Contacting people directly - asking for informal/coffee meetings, introductions, etc. from existing and new relationships.
      Active job seekers are strategic in their system and outreach — like salespeople.

JOB SEARCH FUNNEL
  contacts
    intro calls/coffee dates
      referrals-introductions-connections from above
        interview
          job offer

each step reduces down in quantity, so you have to feed the funnel a lot!
BE ACTIVE
As a committed jobseeker you’ll:
Dedicate the time required for an effective job search by scheduling specific activities in your daily calendar (e.g. 3 hours coding, 2 hours researching opportunities, and 2 hours sending emails)
Build apps, blog, network, and actively outreach to your network
Treat the job search process like a salesperson
Create a special place to track your progress

Summary: This is a 2,000 character advertisement you can write for yourself! Describe how you can benefit a company here and again, be sure to add all your contact information (email, phone, etc.) to make it easy to get a hold of you!

Keywords: 
Be Searchable on LinkedIn. Decide what employers will be searching for to find candidates like you, and then make sure you fill up your profile with those keywords. Your keyword is your job title, core function, or core skill. To come up high in LinkedIn searches for your keyword, add your keyword throughout your profile, but especially in these sections: Headline, Summary, Current Job title, Past job title. To get ideas on all the places to put your keyword, search and look at profiles of other professionals with skills like yours.

LinkedIn Groups: 
LinkedIn also has a forum-like feature on the platform: LinkedIn groups. These groups allow you to connect with likeminded people around a certain interest. Like Ruby on Rails or JavaScript. Groups are great for people who don’t live in big cities, but still want to network. Remember, always provide value to the group you’re in - don’t just promote yourself!

Messaging Functions: 
On LinkedIn you can send direct messages to your connections. There is also a messaging feature called InMail. InMail allows you to connect with LinkedIn members you’re not connected to. However, only premium accounts have InMail capabilities.
