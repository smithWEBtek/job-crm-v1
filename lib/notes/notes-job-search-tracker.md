NOTES for Flatiron School
"Congratulations on launching your job search! We want to support you in the best way possible during this period of your career. We have been working with a group of your fellow grads to design a tool that will help you track the things you are doing to find your next job. Also, if you have signed the Career Services Commitment, this will help you adhere to the Commitment.

Based on the Career Services Commitment, Flatiron School requires Job Seeking Graduates to accomplish many things. This Job Search Tracker will help you keep track of these things on a weekly basis:

- make contact with at least 8 specific individuals at prospective employers within the software development field each week
- post at least 5 GitHub commits per week;
- post at least 1 technical blog post per week on a public URL that can be verified by Flatiron

We are requiring that you maintain this tracker on your job search progress.
